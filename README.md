## Coding Conventions Followed

- Always specify data type of non-initialized variables.
- Used following case style in code:
  - PascalCase <- for class, interface and other type definitions,
  - camelCase <- for naming objects and vars, and
  - UPPERCASE <- for const and enums
- Used 4 spaces format for indentation. Always format code using VS Code format document option (Ctrl+Alt+F for windows) before committing the code.
- Any variable, constant or type name should not exceed 32 chars.
- Use dollar(`$`) suffix, for naming variables of type observables or subjects.
- Try to add comments wherever possible or logic is complex with online reference if available.
- Review, cleanup and remove redundant code before pushing changes to repository.
- Never check in secrets, passwords or protected URLs with code. Use env or other config file for saving confidential settings.
